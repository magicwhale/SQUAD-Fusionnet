The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison ", "5728e8212ca10214002daa70": "responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude", "5705fd8475f01819005e7844": "Transverse and Peninsular ", "572657d9dd62a815002e8230": "melt ", "5711669550c2381900b54ae1": "constant pressure", "56dfb666231d4119001abcc1": "April 1887 ", "573010fab2c2fd14005687d8": "the kingdom", "57111713a58dae1900cd6c04": "E.I. du Pont", "57273f27dd62a815002e9a0d": "firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project", "572fb059947a6a140053cb84": "principal committee room", "572a070c6aef0514001551c8": "better health and longer lives", "5727f746ff5b5019007d9960": "Rose", "56f7c651aef2371900625bf8": "freedom from God's punishment for sin ", "56beb4343aeaaa14008c925b": "308 ", "5729293d3f37b319004780a1": "2003 ", "56f8575aaef2371900626001": "couple earn a living by farming the land ", "572976791d046914007794b0": "the oxygen concentration is too high", "56de4b074396321400ee2795": "Kingdom of Sicily", "57060a1175f01819005e78d4": "cattle and citrus ", "572831512ca10214002da04b": "four ", "56dfb5777aa994140058e022": "electric lighting company ", "572759665951b619008f8887": "Supreme Court ", "5733d68ed058e614000b6380": "Nova Scotia and Newfoundland ", "56f84b68aef2371900625fa9": "Zwickau prophets", "56e7683d00c9c71400d770cb": "sexual abuse with a professional,\" not necessarily a teacher", "5710eb6fb654c5140001fa18": "Charlesfort ", "5726ed6cf1498d1400e8f00e": "Internet ", "5727e9523acd2414000def99": "lower-paid professions", "56bf38383aeaaa14008c956b": "67.9 ", "56e1c0f6cd28a01900c67b2c": "complexity classes ", "56e122dacd28a01900c6763a": "humans' \"pity", "572975511d046914007794a8": "cyclic photophosphorylation ", "56de49564396321400ee277a": "Africa", "56e7591b00c9c71400d76fee": "30 US states ", "56de1645cffd8e1900b4b5d0": "Harthacnut", "57114667a58dae1900cd6d82": "Charles Porter ", "5705f13d52bb8914006896f4": "seven ", "572928bf6aef051400154af0": "six ", "572a0b0b6aef0514001551f8": "cytokine TGF-β", "57264a74708984140094c18c": "atra mors ", "57267c63dd62a815002e86da": "throw\", from the Dutch gooien", "56e10325cd28a01900c67435": "16,000 ", "572754cd5951b619008f8866": "1237 ", "573027d6a23a5019007fce9d": "1985 ", "56f8ac579e9bad19000a02bc": "Martin Brecht", "57286b003acd2414000df9c2": "Karakorum ", "572fd6aa04bcaa1900d76da3": "", "56beb97c3aeaaa14008c92dd": "Chicago Bears ", "57273a465951b619008f86ff": "Construction ", "56e0ef0c231d4119001ac464": "$216,000", "572828383acd2414000df5c4": "Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker ", "57115b8b50c2381900b54a8c": "transport applications", "57287d4a2ca10214002da3e5": "Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin ", "5725b33f6a3fe71400b8952e": "US$3 per barrel ", "57290f963f37b31900477fef": "Kibaki's PNU and Odinga's ODM together and heralded the formation of the grand coalition, in which the two political parties would share power equally", "572fec30947a6a140053cdf3": "Rhine knee", "56d704430d65d214001982e0": "John Elway", "57297a276aef051400154f88": "1640 ", "56bec38b3aeaaa14008c939a": "nine ", "57286d7d4b864d19001649e2": "Halo ", "57274eca5951b619008f8801": "88 ", "56dfa0d84a1a83140091ebb7": "1943", "57298ef11d0469140077952e": "s = −2, −4", "5725c91e38643c19005acced": "", "572f567cb2c2fd1400568040": "1939 ", "5729f5a03f37b31900478608": "γδ T cells) possess an alternative T cell receptor (TCR) as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms", "57302a3aa23a5019007fced2": "Sharia ", "57113c6da58dae1900cd6d34": "Greek ", "5729f5a03f37b31900478609": "Vγ9/Vδ2 ", "5725bc0338643c19005acc12": "miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow.
